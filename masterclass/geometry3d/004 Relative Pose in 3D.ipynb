    "<h3>Relative Pose in 3D</h3>\n",
    "<h6>Two 3-dimensional coordinate frames A and B with the relative pose A ksi B which is the pose of B with respect to A.  Point P can be described in terms of a vector with respect to the origin of coordinate frame A.  Can describe point P with respect to the coordinate frame B.  We can transform a vector from one coordinate frame to another useing the dot operator.</h6>\n",

    "<h6>Can define coordinate frame C with respect to coordinate frame B using the symbol B ksi C.  Can compose the two relative transformations B with respect to A and C with respect to B in order to obtain the relative pose of C with respect to A.  This is obtained using the composition operator.  Now an expression can be obtained for the vector with respect to frame C and the vector with respect to frame A.</h6>\n",
