    "<h6>In three dimensions, we use a coordinate frame that looks like the picture shown below.  Angles x, y, and z meet 90 degrees of each other.  The point of intersection is referred to as the origin.</h6>\n",

    "<h6>Introduce a point and describe the point with respect to the 3D coordinates system.  Drop a line down from the XY plane and measure the displacement a along the x-axis, the displacement b along the y-axis and the displacement c along the z-axis.  This point is described by a tuple (3-tuple) which is (a, b , c).</h6>\n",

    "<h6>Can describe a vector in terms of three components: component a parallel to the x axis, component b parallel to the y axis and component c parallel to the z axis.  Represent vectors using lower case symbols and a column vector.  Column vector is a stack of numbers one above the other.  The distance a, b, and c.</h6>\n",
